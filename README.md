## Arduino program
To make use of "pixel_stripe_wave.ino" you need to install the Arduino IDE, open up the pixel_stripe_wave.ino-file and install the "Adafruit Neopixel" library via the library manager of the IDE.

The board I used is a clone of the "Arduino Pro Micro" which is compatible to the "Arduino Leonardo" board. Pick this as the target board from the menus, connect the Micro-USB-Port on the microcontroller board to your computer (the power lead at the bottom of the lamp does not have the data lines connected). Then use Sketch->Upload to compile the code and upload it to your board.

## G'MIC
You can get the latest version of G'MIC here:

The g'mic simmulation looks like this:

Ues this command to simulate the lamp with G'MIC:
```bash
gmic Lampshade.png -command lamp.gmic -lamp3d
```
